​
  - What are the differences between a variable that is: `null`, `undefined`?
  - What is `use strict`? what are the advantages and disadvantages to using it?
  - What are the differences between `==` and `===`? Write an example for each case (if any)?

  - Give an example for add a new element to an array[] (at the end)
  - Give an example for add a new element to an array[] (at the beginning)
  - Give an example for removing an element in array[]
​
### Playground
1. Write a JavaScript program to compute the sum of the two given integers. If the two values are same, then returns triple their sum.
```
Input: a = 5, b = 10
Output: 15
​
Input: a = 5, b = 5
Output: 30
```
​
2. Write a JavaScript program to compute the absolute difference between a specified number and 19. Returns triple their absolute difference if the specified number is greater than 19.
​
```
Input: a = 12
Output: 7
​
Input: a = 19
Output: 0
​
Input: a = 22
Output: 9
```
​
3. A masked number is a string that consists of digits and one asterisk (*) that should be replaced by exactly one digit. Given a masked number find all the possible options to replace the asterisk with a digit to produce an integer divisible by 3.
​
```
Input: a = '1*9'
Output: ['129', '159', '189']
```
​
```
Input: a = '1234567890*'
Output: ['12345678900', 
 '12345678903', 
 '12345678906', 
 '12345678909']
```
​
4. A masked number is a string that consists of digits and one asterisk (*) that should be replaced by exactly one digit. Given a masked number find all the possible options to replace the asterisk with a digit to produce an integer divisible by 6.
​
```
Input: a = '1*9'
Output: []
```
​
```
Input: a = '1234567890*'
Output: ['12345678900', 
 '12345678906']
```
